# Funfacts chatbot

We created a fun facts chatbot that shows differents facts from different topics through a chat function. The task was to style it in css, write the code in javaScript and have an HTML as well. 

Tools used: VSCode

We created a function to solve the chat flow. 
Added some sound effect. 

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Deployed the project in netlify as well.
